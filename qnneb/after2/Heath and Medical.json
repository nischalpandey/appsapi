    "intro": "Health professionals play a crucial role in enhancing population access to and quality of health care. They administer primary health care to people, families, and communities, promoting health, preventing diseases, and providing health care services. SUB-DISCIPLINES  Public Health Ayurveda Dentistry and Oral Health Medicine Nursing and Midwifery Pharmacy Allied Health Sciences Direct care practitioners such as physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, respiratory therapists, dentists, pharmacists, speech-language pathologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, physical and behavior therapists, and speech-language pathologists, as well as allied health professionals, make up the healthcare workforce. They work in a variety of settings, including hospitals, healthcare centers, and other service delivery places, as well as academic instruction, research, and administration.\nSome patients receive care and therapy in the privacy of their own homes. A considerable number of community health workers labor outside of established healthcare institutions in many nations. Managers of healthcare services, health information technologists, and other assistive professionals and support workers are also important members of healthcare teams.\n\nHealth occupations are a common classification for healthcare providers. Practitioners are frequently classified according to skill level and skill specialization within each sector of competence. Health professionals are highly trained employees who work in fields that often demand substantial knowledge, including university-level studies leading to a first degree or higher qualification. Physicians, physician assistants, registered nurses, veterinarians, veterinary technicians, veterinary assistants, dentists, midwives, radiographers, pharmacists, physiotherapists, optometrists, operating room practitioners, and others are all included in this group.",
